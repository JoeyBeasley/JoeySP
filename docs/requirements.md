Criteria 1: Characters and Text should appear
  
  Motivation: Players should be able to see and read what is going on in-game
  
  Examples: When a character is talking to the player and soemthing is happening, we should be able to see the       character, the background, and text displaying what they are saying.
  
  Fit Criterion: Everytime a character speaks, a text appears in a readable font of at least 12 pts.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 2: Text Options should appear and be clickable
  
  Motivation: Selecting text-based options is what moves the game forward. Visual Novel style games rely on this     so that the plot and gameplay can progress.
  
  Examples: After a character talks to you, you should be given an option to go either left with them, or go to      the right and continue on your own.
  
  Fit Criterion: If these text options display in a readable font and leads to the next textbox and scenario.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 3: The game should keep track of who is alive
 
  Motivation: The more Non Playable Characters that die, the worse ending you get.
 
  Examples: If one of the side characters, like the technician die, rebuilding the ship will be harder. If most     of the crew is dead and your tough as nails engineer is still around, he will abandon you.
 
  Fit Criterion: The game should give you diffferent endings based on who is alive, with some endings being darker depending on who is alive.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 4: The voice clips playing
 
  Motivation: When characters talk or react to something, a voice clip provided by me should play.
  
  Examples: When the technician is talking to you, a voice clip should start that reads out what he is saying.       When he reacts in shock to a dangerous encounter, a sound of shock must exclaim.
  
  Fit Criterion: Hearing the audio.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 5: Counting who is alive
 
  Motivation: There should be an internal counter capping at the number of members still alive.
  
  Examples: The game starts off at the max number of crew members, and if that number is the same by the end, the best ending is rewarded.
  
  Fit Criterion: Running tests on the code to see if the counter keeps up with who is alive.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 6: Counting who is gone
 
  Motivation: There should be an internal counter capping at the number of members who died
  
  Examples: The counter starts at 0, with the number going up everytime a crew member is lost along the way. The higher the count, the worse the ending.
  
  Fit Criterion: Testing to see if the counter increased when a teammate is eliminated.

  ________________________________________________________________
Criteria 7: Play the right audio file
 
  Motivation: The correct audio should play for the respective character and their dialogue.
  
  Examples: The tehcnician has a younger, higher piteched voice, while the engineer has a deeper, gruffer voice. It is important that these two do not get mixed up.
  
  Fit Criterion: Hearing the audio play for the right line and character.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 8: Make the player's name enterable
 
  Motivation: When starting the game, players should enter the name they want to be referred by.
  
  Examples: The name entered at the beggining will be stored in the game.
  
  Fit Criterion: Checking the name variable

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 9: Have the characters refer to the player by their entered name.
 
  Motivation: Once the name is added, it will be included in a name string
  
  Examples: When the technician acknowldges you, he will say, "Hello Captain (name)! Shall we head out?"
  
  Fit Criterion: Testing the name variable in an in-game string.

________________________________________________________________
Criteria 10: Let players save progress
 
  Motivation: A session's data and progress should be saved.
  
  Examples: If a player needs to do something else and come back later, the can click the save button to hold their data.
  
  Fit Criterion: Testing the save feature to see if everything from the session is still intact.
