Criteria 1: Characters and Text should appear
  
  Motivation: Players should be able to see and read what is going on in-game
  
  Examples: When a character is talking to the player and soemthing is happening, we should be able to see the       character, the background, and text displaying what they are saying.
  
  Fit Criterion: If both of these are displayed, it works.


Criteria 2: Text Options should appear and be clickable
  Motivation: Selecting text-based options is what moves the game forward. Visual Novel style games rely on this     so that the plot and gameplay can progress.
  Examples: After a character talks to you, you should be given an option to go either left with them, or go to      the right and continue on your own.
  Fit Criterion: If these text options display and react to being clicked on.


Criteria 3: The game should keep track of who is alive
  Motivation: The more Non Playable Characters that die, the worse ending you get.
  Examples: If one of the side characters, like the technician die, rebuilding the ship will be harder. If most     of the crew is dead and your tough as nails engineer is still around, he will abandon you.
  Fit Criterion: Seeing how the ending is altered based on the number of crew members remaining.


Criteria 4: The voice clips playing
  Motivation: When characters talk or recat to something, a voice clip provided by me should play.
  Examples: When the technician is talking to you, a voice clip should start that reads out what he is saying.       When he reacts in shock to a dangerous encounter, a sound of shock must exclaim.
  Fit Criterion: Hearing the audio.
