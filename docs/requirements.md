Criteria 1: Characters and Text should appear
  
  Motivation: Players should be able to see and read what is going on in-game
  
  Examples: When a character is talking to the player and soemthing is happening, we should be able to see the       character, the background, and text displaying what they are saying.
  
  Fit Criterion: Everytime a character speaks, a text appears in a readable font of at least 12 pts.

Criteria 2: Text Options should appear and be clickable
  
  Motivation: Selecting text-based options is what moves the game forward. Visual Novel style games rely on this     so that the plot and gameplay can progress.
  
  Examples: After a character talks to you, you should be given an option to go either left with them, or go to      the right and continue on your own.
  
  Fit Criterion: If these text options display in a readable font and leads to the next textbox and scenario.

Criteria 3: The game should keep track of who is alive
 
  Motivation: The more Non Playable Characters that die, the worse ending you get.
 
  Examples: If one of the side characters, like the technician die, rebuilding the ship will be harder. If most     of the crew is dead and your tough as nails engineer is still around, he will abandon you.
 
  Fit Criterion: The game should give you diffferent endings based on who is alive, with some endings being darker depending on who is alive.

Criteria 4: The voice clips playing
 
  Motivation: When characters talk or react to something, a voice clip provided by me should play.
  
  Examples: When the technician is talking to you, a voice clip should start that reads out what he is saying.       When he reacts in shock to a dangerous encounter, a sound of shock must exclaim.
  
  Fit Criterion: Hearing the audio.

Criteria 5: Counting who is alive
 
  Motivation: There should be an internal counter capping at the number of members still alive.
  
  Examples: The game starts off at the max number of crew members, and if that number is the same by the end, the best ending is rewarded.
  
  Fit Criterion: Hearing the audio.
