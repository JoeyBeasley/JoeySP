In most visual novel type games, players do not receive any consequence for failure, being allowed to correct themselves or go back to a previous point to fix their mistakes. Adding consequences to somebody's failures in a game not only adds to the challenge, but also makes any error all the more impactful. My idea is to make a game where everyone's survival is dependent on you. This will result in a game that is more impactful on players by giving them perosnal connections to characters that may not survive if things go wrong.

I plan to create a visual novel type of game where you take on the role of a commander of team of space travelers who end up on a desert planet. While you are stuck there, you and your team have to gather materials to fix the ship and go home. All in the while, you have to keep your eyes on your crew, and make sure none of them die. The more the members die, the worse of an ending you wil get. There will also be different endings depending on the members who are left, with some crewmembers being more forgiving and trusting than others. I will design characters and provide vocals for the interactions on top of coding the game.

For the design, I plan to use Python.

My main development key is Ren'py, which runs on Python. It is commonly used to create visual novels. The drawings and character deisgns will be done on ClipStudioPaint. The voices are to be recorded in Audacity.

I don't know of any additional software or equipment, outisde of maybe a Flash drive for storing data

This project will use two things I am passionate about, voiceover work and designing visuals. A challenge will be added for programming games like this and giving indivdual trust stats for the characters. I have also never designed a visual novel or any game of this callibur. Being able to do what my major does while also incorporating my passions are what a senior project like this should accomplish.

I will need to spend time researching and understanding character design a lot better and learn how to design a visual novel. I should take programming a game through Python into consideration as well, since I only had one class covering that language.

I plan to get started on this next semester, as the current one is still underway and rather busy.
