# Spaced Out

You and your space traveling crew have crash landed on a mysterious planet. While your ship is being repaired, it is your duty to not only help get your vessel back up and running, but to look out for your teammates and make sure nobody gets lost, or worse! This will ultilize a sort of point and click gameplay, not too dissimilar from most visual novels. Players can make selections on which character to follow, what direction they will go, and whether or not they will investigate anything strange. The interface features text boxes containing the characters' dialogue, along with buttons containing options on what to do next.

For research I will find guides and tutorials on how to create certain visual novel style games, as there are plenty of platforms out there.

When the fall semester starts, I will begin perparations and research, along with designing the characters before writing the dialgue and recording their voice lines. After having it laid out and getting familiar with the system, I will start programming and designing it, but it may not be the biggest game out there due to time and resources.
