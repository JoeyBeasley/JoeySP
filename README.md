# Spaced Out

You and your space traveling crew have crash landed on a mysterious planet. While your ship is being repaired, it is your duty to not only help get your vessel back up and running, but to look out for your teammates and make sure nobody gets lost, or worse! This will ultilize a sort of point and click gameplay, not too dissimilar from most visual novels.
